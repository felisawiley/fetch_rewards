# Loom Video
Hi there! In this video, I walk you through my thought process while tackling a coding exercise focused on reviewing and structuring JSON data. I discuss the steps I took to evaluate data quality, including identifying missing values and standardizing column names. I also share insights on approaching a project kickoff and the importance of clear communication. Please take a look and let me know your thoughts!
