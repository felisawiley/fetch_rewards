Subject: Data Quality Findings – Need Your Input

Hey [Stakeholder’s Name],

I took a deep dive into the data, and I found a few things we’ll want to clean up to make sure everything is accurate and working as expected. Here are the main takeaways:

What I Found:
Missing Data – A lot of receipts are missing key info like purchase amounts, rewards earned, and even the actual list of items. This makes it hard to track spending trends and ensure users are getting the correct points.
Inconsistent Formats – Some numbers are stored as text, and dates are in a weird nested format instead of proper timestamps. This makes processing the data more complicated than it needs to be.
Duplicates – There are some duplicate brand records.

What I Need From You:
Are those missing values expected? Or should they be there 100% of the time?
Is there a reason dates are stored in this format? If not, I’d like to clean them up for consistency.
Are those duplicated brand records expected or do I need to remove them?

Looking Ahead:
If this data is going to scale, we’ll want to set up some rules to prevent missing info and make sure everything is stored in the right format from the start. Let me know your thoughts so we can get this cleaned up!

Best,
Felisa
